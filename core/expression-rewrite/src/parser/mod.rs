//! Parses Tokens into AST
//!
//! The Parser module processes tokens from the Lexer, constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
//!
//! It's available in two specialized variants:
//! - Standard, designed for comprehensive expression evaluation yielding any result
//! - Unary, specifically created for truthy tests with exclusive boolean outcomes
